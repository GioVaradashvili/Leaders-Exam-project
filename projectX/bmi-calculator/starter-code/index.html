    <h2>Healthy eating</h2>
    <br>
    <h4>Healthy eating promotes weight control,
    <br>disease prevention, better digestion, 
    immunity, <br>
    mental clarity,
    <br>and mood.</h4>
    <br>

    <br>
    <h2>Regular exercise</h2>
    <br>
    <h4>Exercise improves fitness, <br>
    aids weight control, elevates mood, <br>
    and reduces disease 
    risk, <br>
  fostering wellness and longevity.</h4>
  <br>
  <img src="icon-sleep.svg" alt="">
  <br>
  <h2>Adequate sleep</h2>
  <br>
  <h4>Sleep enhances mental clarity, <br>
  emotional stability, <br>
  and physical wellness, <br>
  promoting 
  overall restoration and rejuvenation.</h4>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h1>Limitations of BMI</h1>
  <br>
  <h4>  Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, <br>
  it is not suited for 
  every person. Specific groups should carefully consider their BMI outcomes, <br>
  and in 
  certain cases, <br>
  the measurement may not be beneficial to use.</h4>
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="icon-gender.svg" alt="">
  <br>
  <h2>gender</h2>
  <h4> The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary with age. <br>
  Consequently, 
  a child's age and gender <br>
  are considered when evaluating their BMI.</h4>
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="icon-age.svg" alt="">
  <br>
  <h2>Age</h2>
  <h4>In aging individuals, increased body <br>
   fat and muscle loss may <br>
  cause BMI to underestimate 
  body fat content.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <img src="icon-muscle.svg" alt="">
  <br>
  <h2>Muscle</h2>
  <h4>
    BMI may misclassify muscular <br>
   individuals as overweight or obese, <br>
   as it doesn't 
    differentiate muscle from fat.</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="icon-pregnancy.svg" alt="">
    <h2>Pregnancy</h2>
    <br>
    <h4>Expectant mothers experience weight gain due
      <br> to their growing baby. Maintaining a 
      healthy pre-pregnancy BMI is advisable to <br>
      minimise health risks for both mother 
      and child.</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="icon-race.svg" alt="">
    <h2>Race</h2>
    <br>
    <h4> Certain health concerns may affect individuals
      <br>
      of some Black and Asian origins at 
      lower BMIs than others. To learn more, <br>
      it is advised to discuss this with your 
      GP or practice nurse.
